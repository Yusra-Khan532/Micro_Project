## Student Enrollment Form

This is basically a form in which student data can be stored. When the user fills out the new entry and hits the save button, the data is stored in the database. When the user enters the stored roll no. (primary key), then the related information can be extracted from the database and can be automatically seen in the form. Here we have three buttons: update, reset, and save.

JSON PowerDB is used to store the student's data in this case. Because of its NoSQL and Serverless support features, it reduces development time. We just need its ready-to-use API, and we can connect the form directly to the database.
